# Financial Analysis (3 Statement Financial Model)
Arnav Chaturvedi.  
Project Role: Financial Analyst – Financial Technology Services Industry.

## Portfolio Project Overview:
Chaturvedi FinTech Products, LLC is a FinTech startup company to help small businesses (focusing on minority owned small businesses) with their financial needs- businesses seeking to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services such as ...
-	Payment Processors and Hardware support.
-	Merchant Services Provider.
-	POS (Point-of-Sales) support.
As a financial analyst, I created this three-statement financial model for Chaturvedi FinTech Products, LLC to analyze a company's revenue, expenses, cash, debt, equity, and cash flow over time, and use them to determine why these items have changed.

The income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows are required financial statements. 
These three statements are informative tools that a company can use to analyze a company's financial strength and provide a quick picture of a company's financial health and underlying value.

## Business Problem Scenarios, Objectives and KPIs:
The finance manager in Chaturvedi FinTech Products, LLC would like to know/analyze a company’s revenue, expenses, cash, debt, equity, and cash flow over time, and use them to determine why these items have changed.

## Target Stakeholders:
This financial analysis tool will be used for following job roles to increase their productivity and achieve business goals. 
•	Finance Manager
•	Chief Finance Officer (CFO)
•	Financial Analysts
•	Business Analysts
•	Financial Regulation Authorities
•	Financial Auditors


## Skills and Applications used: 
•	Microsoft Excel 
o	Knowledge of formulae and functions to be used in any typical financial data analytical solutions.

•	SME (Subject Matter Expertise)
o	Business requirement gathering skill and techniques.
o	Finance knowledge and expertise.
	Income Statements
	Balance Sheets
	Statement of cash flows
	Related all key line items
	Types of assumptions: making forecast figures for future years.

## Solution Approach and Process to build this project:
I created a three-statement model linking the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement into a dynamic financial model used for valuation (discounted cash flows, M&A models, LBOs etc.) as well as financial analysis (scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis etc.).

Solution Steps:
1.	Build an income statement using assumptions.
2.	Create schedules to model complex items.
3.	Build a balance sheet using assumptions.
4.	Build a cash flow statement
5.	Link all three statements together.

•	First, organize and build the income statement using a set of assumptions. 
•	Next, create schedules to model out more complex line items like CapEx and Depreciation. 
•	Following that, build out the balance sheet. 
•	Lastly build up the cash flow statement and link the 3 statements together.
•	Form good financial modelling visibility using font colors, formulas, and custom formatting.


## Notes (for Linking 3 Statements together):
-	For “Income Statement”:
-	Made a few assumptions such as Revenue, Average Price, Discounts, COGS, Operating Expenses, Tax etc.
-	EBITDA (Depreciation and Amortization) amounts will be blank for now. This will be filled when the data comes from calculated figures from the “Fixed Asset” step later on.
-	EBIT (Interest Expense) amounts will be blank for now. This will be filled when the data comes from calculated figures from “Balance Sheet” step later on.
  
-	For “Fixed Assets”:
-	Made a few assumptions and calculated the CapEx and depreciation schedule with actual/estimated figures.
-	Link these calculated figures to the EBITDA (Depreciation and Amortization) line item in the “Income Statement” tab from earlier.
-	For “Balance Sheet”:
-	Made a few assumptions such as the Net Revenue, COGS, Debt etc.
-	I used the calculation line for the ‘Balance Check’ which automatically validates the balance sheet’s accuracy (i.e. Assets = Liabilities - Equity).
-	“Net Revenue” and COGS figures will link and come from calculated line items in the “Income Statement” tab above.
-	“Fixed Assets” figures will link and come from the “Fixed Asset” Total CapEx line items calculated above. 
-	“Accumulated Depreciation” figures will link and come from the “Fixed Asset” Total D&A line items calculated above.
-	“Equity” figures will link and come from the “Income Statement” Net Income line items calculated above.
-	“Interest Payment” figures will link to the “Income Statement” EBIT-Interest Expense line item.


-	For “Cash Flow Statement”:
-	To make the balance sheet accurate, i.e. have all zeros in the “Balance Check” line, we need to create a cash flow statement with appropriate figures (current assets: cash).
-	“Net Income” line item will link and come from the “Income Statement” Net Income line item.
-	“Depreciation” line item will link and come from the “Fixed Assets” Total D&A line item.
-	“Change in Account Receivable” line item will link and come from the “Balance Sheet” Account Receivable line item.
-	“Change in Account Payable” line item will link and come from the “Balance Sheet” Account Payable line item. 
-	“CapEx” line item will link and come from the “Fixed Assets” Total CapEx line item. 
-	“Debt Repayment” and “Net Borrowing” line items will link and come from the “Balance Sheet” Debt Repayment and Net Borrowing line items. 
-	Now, link and fill “Cash” figures into the “Balance Sheet” line item.
 
-	For accuracy of the 3 statements linking and “Balance Sheet”:
-	After following all steps and linking the 3 statements together, the “Balance Check” line is all zero, thus it is accurate.

To achieve the company’s objective and develop analytical tools to support business requirements, I used the following subject matter knowledge and Microsoft Excel skills:
-	Advanced Excel functions/formulae.
-	EDATE() – Date manipulation and custom cell formatting (for Estimated and Actual) e.g. yyyy/E, mmm-yy/A
-	Formula to make a cell dynamic (Tile for line items. e.g.  “=B6&” as % of Rev”)
-	Visual Formatting; style as per company’s UI/UX standards.

## Data Preparation Process (Data gathering, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation): 
•	Data Gathering – The Dataset (Microsoft Excel/ CSV File).
o	Data Sheet: 4 tabs in MS-Excel workbook (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cashflows, Fixed Assets)
o	Few assumptions in each tab for financial modeling.
•	Data Pre-Processing and Transformation.
o	Cell formatting, proper cell indentation as per financial reports standards.
o	Calculations for totals and sub-totals for report line items.
o	Creating new custom formatting for columns

## Data Analysis & Visualization – Dashboard, Reports, Charts, Key findings, Data Insights:
•	Used proper visual formatting as per financial reports standards – Totals, Sub-Totals, Bold, Underlines etc.
•	No visualization charts required for this project.
•	Refer to screenshots below for reports for this solution.
